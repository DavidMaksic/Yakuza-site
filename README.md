# Yakuza Kiwami 2 Website Redesign

Yakuza Kiwami 2 website is a redesign based on the original website showcasing SEGA's remake of an old classic. It was built mainly with HTML and vanilla CSS, with few JavaScript functionalities.

Website is designed based on franchise's well known colors, with CSS tricks to make the design more appealing. Features responsive design to make the browsing possible on many devices.
